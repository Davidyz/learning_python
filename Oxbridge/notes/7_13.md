Control structures:

    Control flow is the order that instructions are executed in a program.

    Forms of control:
        Sequential control
        Selection control(if)
        iterative control(for, while)

    Boolean values:
        Boolean data type:
            True & False

        Boolean expression:
            An expression that evaluates to a Boolean value.

            Relational operators:
                ==
                !=
                >
                <
                >=
                <=

            Boolean operators:
                and:
                    1 and 1 == 1
                    1 and 0 == 0
                    0 and 0 == 0

                or:
                    1 or 1 == 1
                    1 or 0 == 1
                    0 or 0 == 0

                not:
                    not 1 == 0
                    not 0 == 1

    Short-Circuit evaluation:
            And:
                If the first operand is False:
                    The whole chunk is considered as false, regardingless of the second.
            Or:
                if the first operand is True:
                    The whole chunk is considered as True, regardingless of the second.
