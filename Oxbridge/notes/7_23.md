Object- oriented programming:
    
    Class:
        A blueprint or a template definition of data items and actions.
        The physical item based on the calss definition is an object. Thus, objects are instances of class.

    Attributes:
        Class variables

    Methods:
        Class functions or actions that an object is able to perform.

    Instantiation:
        Creating an object and allocating memory to that object.

    Syntax:
        class Object:
            statement 1:
            statement 2:
            ......
            statement n:
    
    Constructor:
        def __init__(self, *arg):
            self.x = 1.0
            ......

        *arg is not necessary.

        __init__ method:
            Called whenever an object of the class is constructed in order to initialise the attributes of the class.

        __doc__ method:
            Used to documenting the class.
            Can be defined individually or just use doc string.
