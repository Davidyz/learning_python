Sequences:
    
    A linear data structure, meaning that its elements have a linear ordering(list and tuple).

    Element Types:
        Same types or different types.

    Length:
        Fixed length or varying length.

    Modifiability:
        Mutable(list) or ummutable(tuple).

    Operations:
        Determining the length of a list;
        Access(retrieve) elements of a list;
        Insert(append) items into a list;
        Remove elements from a list.

    Zero-based indexing:
        The index begins at 0, not 1.

    Data in tuple can be accessed faster than in list because a tuple is fixed.

    List traversal:
        A mean of accessing, one-by-one, each element of a list.

        It can be used to add up all items or searching a specific item in a list.

    Tuple:
        Immutable linear data structure.

For statements:
    
    An iterative control statement that iterates once for each element in a specified sequence of elements.
    All for loops are definite loop.

    Iterating through list elements vs list index:
        for i in list:              vs              for i in range(len(list)):
