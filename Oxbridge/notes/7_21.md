Procedure-oriented Programming:
    
    The program is specifically designed to solve a particular problem.
    Time consuming for complex problem and low flexibility between similar tasks.
    
    Collecting data from user
    -> Performing some calculations(manipulations) on the collected data
    -> Display the result(visualisation) to the user when requested

Object-oriented Programming:
    
    Object:
        Bundle together data structures(attributes) and procedures(methods)

    An object is an instance of a class.
    Class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviour/state that the object of its type supports.
    -> Object becomes an instance of the class.
