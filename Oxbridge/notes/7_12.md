Operators:
    
    A symbol that represents an operation that may be performed on one or more 'operands'.

Expressions and data types:
    
    Expressions:
        A combination of symbols that evaluates to a value
        It can consist of one single literal or variable.
        It is useful to use brackets to avoid ambiguity.

    Data types:
        A set of values, and operators that may be appied to these values.
        
        Dynamic typing:
            The data type of a variable depends only on the type of value that the variable is currently using.
            Eg. Python

        Static typing:
            A variable is declared as a certain type before it is used.
            Eg. c/c++, Java

        Mixed type expression:
            An exppression containging operands of diffenrent types. 
            The CPU can only perform operations on values with the same internal representation scheme, and thus only on operands of the same type.
