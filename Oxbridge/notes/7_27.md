Inheritance:
    
    When a class uses code constructed within another class.
    Classes called child classes or subclasses inherit methods and variables from parent classes or base classes.

    >>> class BaseClass():
    >>>     pass
    >>>
    >>> class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    >>>     def __init__(self):
    >>>         BaseClass.__init__(self)
    >>>
    >>>     pass

Polymorphism:
    
    When a method can give different output depending on the objects.

    Abstract class:

        It does not have any implementation but defines the structure (in form of functions) that all classes and subclasses must have.
