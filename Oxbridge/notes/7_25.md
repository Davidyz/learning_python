Encapsulation:
    
    A way to hide the source code when distributing the code, so that the access to methods and variables are restricted.
    This prevent the data from being modified by accident.

    Private attributes:
        Variables that can only be accessed or modified by methods in the same class.

        A class variable that cannot directly accessed should be prefixed with an underscore.
        
        In order to change them, 'getter' or 'setter' methods are required.

        >>> class Robot():
        ...     def __init__(self):
        ...         self.a = 123
        ...         self._b = 456
        ...         self.__c = 789
        
        Single underscore:
            Private variable.
            Should not, but can be accessed directly.

        Double underscore:
            Private variable.
            Hard to access, but still possible.

        getter and setter:
            
        ...         def getc(self):
        ...             return self.__c
        ...         def setc(self, c):
        ...             self.__c = c
